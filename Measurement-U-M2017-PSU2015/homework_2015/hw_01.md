I want you to approach analysis of the attached data from a naive perspective. This is a chance to explore the data without reference to any statistical tool. Use what ever software or approach you want. SPEND NO MORE THAN 1 to 2 HOURs working with the data. Save the code (R or stata) for me and annotate it with comments about what you did. I'd like you write up a few sentences about the relationships you discover (if any). This write up can be a comment in the R or stata script file.

Feel free to use Stan or JAGS if you want but this is not necessary for this first assignment though you are welcome to push yourselves. Feel free to use any of the code I sent yesterday to help you get started. 

Let me know if you have any questions about the data, the code, or anything else.

Please alert me of any coding errors if you cannot resolve them after 10-15 minutes. 

I want you to start thinking about analogies when it comes to the links between your theoretical ideas and the data used to model those concepts and relationships. In that spirit, think of this dataset as a sand box. There are no right or wrong answers this week.
